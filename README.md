<h1>Domoticz and RaspBerry Pi (and other Linux single-board computers)</h1>
<p>This repo describes how to use RaspBerry Pi to create end elements for Domoticz server. Instead of RaspBerry Pi, you can use other linux single-board *Berry computers as Orange Pi, Bannana Pi etc. It is tested on Intel Edison also.</p>
<p>There are three simple examples. There are two different possibilities to create switch - by the using Python a very simple example with php web page. Last example is temperature sensor which is using I2C sensor TC74A0.</p>
<p>You can use only one RaspbBerry Pi for testing all of this examples together. You only need minimal 2A power supply. I tested all thre examples on one RaspBerry Pi Zero together</p>
<p>The examples were tested on the Raspberry Pi 2 B and Raspberry Pi Zero, both with installed Raspbian Jessie and on the Intel Edison with GPIO block and I2C block with installed Ubilinux.</p>
