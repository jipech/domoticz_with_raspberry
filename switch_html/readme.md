<h1>Creating switch for Domoticz by the using web page</h1>
<p>In this example the switch controled over HTML and PHP is created. You need any linux single-board machine. You have to install on it apache2 server with PHP support. It is described <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/apache.md">here</a>. Then you place the file index.php to the root folder of web server.</p>
<p>Now you can plug the relay or testing LED to the RPi. The data cabel relay (or + LED) plug to the pin 27, VCC to the 5V and GND to GND. The pinout for Raspberry Pi B+, 2, 3 and Zero is for example <a href="https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-73950/l/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-gpio-40-pin-block-pinout">here</a>. If you use Intel Edison, then you have to change number of the pin. It is good described directly on the gpio block. You can check function by the web browser now.</p>
<p>If everything function you can set up the Domoticz server now. Create the virtual sensor in the dummy device. Edit it and set type as the On/Off and icon as the Lamp switch. Then type in the field On action text "http://ip.switch/index.php?led=ON" and in the field Off action "http://ip.switch/index.php?led=OFF".</p>
<p>It is all. You can check it in the Domoticz now.</p>
