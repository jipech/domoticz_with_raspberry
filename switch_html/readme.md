<h1>Creating switch for Domoticz by the using web page</h1>
<p>In this example the switch controled over HTML and PHP is created. You need any linux single-board machine. You have to install on it apache2 server with PHP support. It is described <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/apache.md">here</a>. Then you place the file index.php to the root folder of web server.</p>
<p>Now you can plug the relay or testing LED to the RPi. The data cabel relay (or + LED) plug to the pin 27, VCC to the 5V and GND to GND. The pinout for Raspberry Pi B+, 2, 3 and Zero is for example <a href="https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-73950/l/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-gpio-40-pin-block-pinout">here</a>.
